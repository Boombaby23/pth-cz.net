<div title="20.11.2014 16:01:45"><b>Carsent :</b> This loony must have read the even more historically ilterilate Mark Levin&#39;s book.  These paranoid psychotics would only be dangers to themselves were it not for the probabiity that others who are feeble minded would follow their erroneous lead.  This poor cretin, like Levin, has no understanding of the Founders or of the 18th century intellectual history necessary to understand them.  For some reason, we are to believe that power and tyranny (sic) is carried out in the name of the nation&#39;s most dispossessed.  I guess the trillions of dollars that have been stolen from our economy by those who control capital, NOT CAPITALISTS, and the situation hundreds of millions are now in is not tyranny.  The Founders ardently opposed control of the economy by those who did not produce goods and services, but who, rather, made their wealth through the manipulation of capital.  There is tyranny all right, but it&#39;s the tyranny of those who would break our economy for their own self-interests.  Levin and the as meager minded Mark Alexander need to do some reading and not listen to Rush Limbaugh so much, who knows even less than either of them.  The repeated errors and distortions about  original intent  are so egregious as to be laughable.  These fools have no understanding about schedules of rights and the nature of  liberty  in political thought, especially 18th century political thought.  If they did, the might know something about the status of property in natural rights and the constitution.  But this is not about political thought, or even discourse on liberty.  The purpose served by Alexander and Levin, a gnome of a creature resembling  Seinfeld&#39;s  George Costanza on a bad hit of acid, is to run interference and divert attention in the interest of the plutocracy, the real tyrants, whose antics would have been a far greater abomination to the Founders than any of the putative  statism  (sic) so stupidly named and invoked by lightweight pogey boys for the plutocracy.  Happy 4th of July.  How chagrined and ashamed the Founders would be could they hear the silliness attributed to them by the likes of Alexander and Levin.
