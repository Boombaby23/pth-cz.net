<h3>HOW IT ALL BEGAN</h3>
<i>By Charles Corwin
Excerpt taken from a talk given at the South Asia Tyrannus Halls Conclave, Feb. 21-23, 2003</i>
<pre>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
Forty-four 44 years ago [1959], the right person and the right
situation came together for the first Tyrannus Hall. I was 33 at the
time, and had made enough mistakes in life to caution me in using the
term, &ldquo;I'm sure this is God's will.&rdquo; Unlike the seers and
prophets, most of us do not receive direct revelation from God about
ministry. Instead, we have the Holy Spirit to guide us. We are to
follow His leading, but He leaves the details to us. In every culture
and generation those details vary with the situation and our own
personalities. The Holy Spirit honors both. He brings <I>people</I>
and <I>situations</I> across our paths and expects us to be sensitive
to those people and situations, following His leading step by step,
so we can effectively carry out the mandate, &ldquo;Make disciples of
all nations.&rdquo;

<h4>I. The Favorable Situation</h4>
In 1957 Elouise and I had
taken up residence in Tokyo's outskirts. We were Associates of the
Fukuin Dendo Kyodan, a Japanese evangelical denomination we worked
under in north central Japan. Rural churches were losing <I>many</I>
youth to Tokyo; they go there for college or employment. Japanese
pastors encouraged Elouise and me to move to Tokyo and work among
them. But country pastors had no ideas on how to do this.

We first tried what was
apparently working in cities like Kobe and Nagoya&mdash;setting up a
Gospel Hall in downtown areas to reach passers-by at night. Waseda
University with 30,000 students was an hour from our Tokyo home. Just
around the corner from the university main gate, our mission built a
small Gospel Hall and called it the Waseda Student Center. After a
year of pulling students in, playing ping-pong with them, serving
refreshments, etc we had little to show for such effort. In the Fall
of 1958, while praying about the student ministry and its lack of
response, I came across Acts 19:9-10. The conditions Paul faced in
Ephesus seemed similar to ones we were facing: it says, &ldquo;the
Ephesians became obstinate and refused to believe.&rdquo; So Paul
took the disciples with him and reasoned daily in the lecture Hall of
Tyrannus. That is, Paul put a structure on his ministry, a structure
that enabled him to be with the same people daily. That is the
essence of what missiologists call, &ldquo;life-involvement
discipling.&rdquo; The results? Those young disciples spread the Word
throughout all Asia. The word &ldquo;Asia&rdquo; jumped out at me. How
could we do that?

While pondering this,
within days we received an unexpected visit from a farmer, Mr. Hoya.
He was the owner of the land on which our new house was built. When I
say built I mean reconstructed. We purchased a small wooden house on
a US army base for $600, had it torn
down, trucked to Tokyo and rebuilt. But, back to my story. Dressed in
blue, soiled work togs and rubber boots,
Mr. Hoya leaned his hoe against the side of the house, removed his
boots and stepped up from the entryway.

&ldquo;Please
have some tea,&rdquo; offered Elouise. &ldquo;I'll have it ready in a
minute.&rdquo;

oya began with an
apology: &ldquo;Your son has been helping me in the fields. I tried to
dissuade him. Told him he'd muddy his clothes. But he insisted,
saying, 'Mother will wash them.&rdquo;'

&ldquo;Well, that's a surprise,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;We can't get him to work around the
house.&rdquo;

&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo;
Hoya continued, &ldquo;I think Japanese boys need teachings from the
Bible.&rdquo;

&ldquo;I agree, but why do you say that?&rdquo; I asked, somewhat puzzled.

&ldquo;I've been working the fields here for years. Children pass by on the way to school but
never say a word, let alone ask to help.&rdquo;

I didn't know if Hoya was being polite or had something else in mind. I broached a sensitive
subject: &ldquo;Well, we'd like to build something where we could
teach students, but land prices are beyond us.&rdquo;

Hoya thought for a moment, then looked up: &ldquo;I can't donate the plot next to your
house. I hold it in trust for my family. But I can lease it. It's
large enough, isn't it?

&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; I
said, &ldquo;But we can't afford to pay lease rights.&rdquo;

&ldquo;How about paying in
monthly installments?&rdquo; said Hoya.

uch an offer couldn't be
refused. The land was leased. News traveled fast back to the north
country. A Japanese pastor, wanting to invest a small inheritance,
sent lumber and carpenters to build a student residence hall. Student
fees would provide more income for him than bank interest. We ceased
operations at the Waseda Student Center
and rented out the facility to the Yomiuri newspaper. Rent enabled us
to repay the pastor for his investment with interest. He was
reluctant to do that, but pastors of his denomination stepped in and
got his compliance.

The two-storied wooden
structure was completed in 1959. To attract students we prepared
small posters to place in the Student Affairs sections of different
Tokyo universities. Those posters offered room and board at a price
lower than the going rate. Free English lessons were thrown in.
Students applied in great number. Within a week we filled the Hall
with Christians and non-Christians alike. That was our first mistake.

Let me explain why. The
model we were following was the so-called 19<SUP>th</SUP> century
&ldquo;band movement&rdquo; in Japan. A 100 years before us,
young men gathered in resident halls near major colleges. Christian
educators - William S. Clark in Hokkaido, Captain L.L. Janes in
Kumamoto, Dr. James Hepburn in Yokohama, arrested the attention of samurai
youth enrolled in those colleges. Some were converted. After declaring
themselves Christian by signing a pledge, such as the <I>Covenant of Believers
in Jesus</I> of the Sapporo Band in Hokkaido, students met together in those
halls and discussed scripture and its implication for their lives.
The missionaries came and went; so in-depth discipling was carried on
by students themselves. We had forgotten this crucial difference
between a Christian dormitory and a Tyrannus Hall. One is for
convenience, monitored by wardens, the other for discipling,
monitored by committed upperclassmen.

Now lets return to Tokyo 40 years ago. After 4 years of -operating our new
Hall in Fushimi, in the summer of 1963, around a campfire in a
mountain village in north central Japan, the students and I discussed
what was happening at the Hall. We were on a summer evangelistic
mission. Some of the students were not yet Christians. They had come
along for the fun. We had them do camp chores while the rest of us
went into the town with megaphones to do street preaching. Most had
bedded down for the night. A few Christians were still awake. We
gazed into the fire. I asked them, &ldquo;What's wrong at the Hall? I
see no spiritual progress among the Christians and the non-Christians
have made no commitment to Christ.&rdquo;

One of the more
perceptive students answered: &ldquo;You're trying to do two things at
once, disciple and evangelize. Focus on one. What will it be?&rdquo;

The Bible is clear. <I>Make
disciples of all nations, so</I> I answered, &ldquo;The Hall should be
for discipling Christian students. But how can we change?&rdquo;

&ldquo;We agree,&rdquo; the
students replied. &ldquo;Leave management of the Hall to us. We'll
make the change.&rdquo;

nd they did. I stood
behind them during the transition. Some students left, but Tyrannus
Hall was born. Thereafter, by trial and error, they established the
four pillars&mdash;student-led devotions three mornings per week,
two-hour theological lectures once a week, three hours of sports per
week, one week of mission each summer. To my amazement, evangelism by
our students took a quantum leap. They formed small groups on
campuses that later became affiliated with KGK, the Japan branch of
the International Federation of Evangelical Students (IFES). Tokyo TH
has developed not a few leaders for KGK.

<h4>II. The Committed Person</h4>
Having a Hall facility
takes you only half-way. The last half&mdash;having the right
residential discipler&mdash;in many respects is the more difficult
half. Let me remind each one of you that the present Halls exist not
because of a building but because of you and your commitment to
students. You voluntarily adopted the boys and girls living in the
Halls. Without you, nothing happens. The halls would be merely Halls,
not a warm, loving, Christian home away from home. What kind of
person should be watching over students, setting an example for them,
being a loving parent to them?

Here again prayer is
needed. Only the Holy Spirit knows the heart, and upon Him we must
depend. Not a governing board, not a denomination, but the Lord
himself. When you finally see that Hall stand before you, you
remember the days of uncertainty, the problem of funding, the land
issue, etc. All will prove to be labor lost unless you find the right
person or persons to disciple your charges. No amount of questions,
no recommendation, no personal compatibility with you, can be the
deciding factor. You need time to see how the would-be resident staff
relates to students and how they to him.

I speak from experience.
The one I chose for Tokyo 15 years ago seemed perfect. An athlete. A
seminary graduate. Good sense of humor. An outdoorsman. A graduate of
the Hall. He and I were and are today the best of friends. However,
he himself never said he was called to students. He accepted the
position because the hall seemed to be in need. We were putting a
good man in the wrong place. It was my idea, not his. We limped along
for these 15 years until just a year ago I had to suggest he move on.
I had made a serious mistake, and the Japanese expected me to correct
it.

But Lord Himself set
aside His own vessel to make life-involvement discipling go on
despite my bungling. He did this through a small woman. She came to
us through a Japanese pastor of that same denomination I first
mentioned. He met her in a Hokkaido church while on a preaching
mission. She and her baby had been recently abandoned by her husband
whom she thought was a Christian. She needed work. We needed a cook.
Her family first insisted that the baby be given up to an adoption
agency; a divorced woman with child stood little chance of
remarrying. Mrs. Kito dutifully obeyed, turned over the baby and came
to Tokyo.

Mrs. Kito had gone
through so much at a young age she had little confidence in herself.
So she prays over everything: before she cooks breakfast in the early
hours of the morning; before she goes shopping to get the best buys&hellip;.
Go to her room, there is always a Bible out. She reads and prays. She
is there when students return from school, tired, and wanting someone
to talk to. I still see her small frame bending over the stove, and a
boy standing nearby talking with her as she asks different questions
about that day. When students are sick, she is there with special
food and drink. When they want to relax and look at TV, they come to
her staff quarters. They discuss politics, sports, school, anything
while she sits quietly and listens. She always has tea and cookies
for them. If you would ask her, &ldquo;How do you disciple students?&rdquo;
She'd probably answer, &ldquo;Who me?&rdquo; You see, the best
discipler is not a discipler. He is a servant.

The Lord in His mercy
allowed Elouise and me to get close to Mrs. Kito. During her first
year, I noticed she rarely smiled. One week when she looked
particularly sad, I asked her if something was troubling her. She
said,
&ldquo;Yes. I just
received the adoption papers from Hokkaido. They found a couple to
adopt my daughter.&rdquo;

Whereupon I asked her, &ldquo;Are they a Christian couple?&rdquo;

&ldquo;No.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Then you can't turn over to them your responsibility
to raise your daughter as a Christian. Have you signed the release?&rdquo;

&ldquo;No.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Do you want to raise her ?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Oh, yes!.&rdquo; She said.

&ldquo;Alright. I'll write
the letter to the Adoption Agency. Take this money, get on the next
train, go get your daughter.&rdquo;

I pulled out the
letterhead of the Evangelical Missionary Association of Japan and
wrote, requesting Mrs. Kito's desires be honored and the baby turned
over to her. I just happened to be president that year and decided to
use that office to make the transfer happen. That daughter became her
life-long companion. She is married to a Lutheran pastor, has three
children and lives not 20 minutes away.

So despite <I>my</I>
mistake 15 years ago, discipling goes on. Every summer before
students go on their summer mission, she is there helping them
prepare and there when they return. After they leave the hall, she
follows them up with regular cards and personal notes. When they get
married, she goes to the wedding if at all possible and presents the
couple a wooden plaque with Scripture text. When children are born,
she sends them a congratulatory note; thereafter those children get
birthday cards every year.

After a student graduates
from college and leaves Tyrannus Hall, she keeps track of them with
notes and phone calls. Almost every time I go back, she has a list of
those boys who qualify to become members of the Tokyo Band. I take
them a pledge card on which it says, &ldquo;I dedicate my life
to Christ, His Church and the World.&rdquo; Also it says, &ldquo;I
will take the following responsibility for TH&rdquo; and lists options
of faithful prayer, recruiting students, or finance. Those who sign
are given a tie-pin to remind them they are members of the Tokyo
Band. Here is the tie pin they wear. We have about 50 members of the
band.

It is no wonder the
students have created a retirement fund for her. But she can't retire
until her replacement is found, for she knows that unless someone
truly cares, Tokyo Tyrannus Hall will become a noisy gong and a
clanging cymbal in Christ's kingdom.
