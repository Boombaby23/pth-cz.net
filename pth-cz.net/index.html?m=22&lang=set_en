<h4>Sport and Group Activities</h4><p>
 We like to play sports and not just for the sport itself: playing soccer, volleyball and basketball together creates a strong bond between us. Our goal isn&#39;t to become world champions but more so to have fun and release the tensions of the day. Every year in the fall, we spend a weekend together around a particular theme. Once, we took a trip to Budapest to visit our Hungarian counterparts - the Budapest Tyrannus Hall.
 <p class="i">
 I buffet my body and make it my slave, lest possibly, after I have preached to others, I myself should be disqualified. (1&nbsp;Cor&nbsp;9:25)
</p></p>
<h4>Ministry</h4><p>
 At the PTH, students have the opportunity to grow in their respective abilities and gifts. We prepare our own ministry events. For example, in 2005 we organized a weekend of ministry in a church plant in Vlasim, Czech Republic. Or in 2008, five of us travelled around the United States to encourage churches that had supported the PTH. We also take part in evangelization efforts of the Cerny Most Church (which meets in the PTH).
 There are also possibilities to serve through sports ministries, through the Cerny Most church plant in our building, through coordinating PTH building maintenance as well as by handling all the PTH finances. Each one of us is involved in some kind of weekly ministry in the local church.
 In such a way, we gain experience that will help us in the future, wherever God calls us.
<p class="i">
 For you were called to freedom, brethren; only do not turn your freedom into an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another.(Gal&nbsp;5:13)
</p></p>
<h4>Prayer Groups</h4><p>
 We are strengthened and encouraged by an hour of corporate praise and prayer that we have every other week. Each week we also gather in small groups of 3 or 4 to pray for one another, not just for our own personal needs but also for the needs of our churches and for the public ministries we have. In this way, our inner spiritual lives are greatly strengthened
<p class="i">
 Confess your sins to one another, and pray for one another, so that you may be healed.
 (Jak&nbsp;5:16)
</p></p>
<h4>Theological Lectures</h4><p>
 One of the most important corporate activities of our week is a two-hour theological lecture. Our leaders or invited lecturers (usually teachers at the Evangelical Theological Seminary) help us understand the Bible and today&#39;s world. For example, we had no idea how the art of living was so clearly presented in the book of Proverbs. Or when an engineer from America who worked on the Stealth fighter jet humbly talks about his work as well as his experience in the largest church in the US, it is a real encouragement to us.
<p class="i">
 But when some were becoming hardened and disobedient, speaking evil of the Way before the multitude, he withdrew from them and took away the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus.<br>
 (Sk&nbsp;19,9)
