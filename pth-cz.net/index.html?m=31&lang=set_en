<b>Coming by underground &ldquo;Metro&rdquo;:</b><br />
Take the &ldquo;B&rdquo; or &ldquo;Green&rdquo; metro line to the end station &ldquo;Černý Most.&rdquo; You will step off the metro train onto the platform that is on the right side of the train. Stay on this level and continue walking in the direction the train was going. You will exit through glass doors to the outside. If you keep walking in this same direction, you will eventually come to a large shopping center called &ldquo;Centrum Černý Most.&rdquo; Walk through the shopping center and exit out the far side. When you exit, you will need to cut through the parking lot at approximately a 45% angle to your right. There you will find an underpass below a four-lane highway. Go through this underpass. About 50 meters on the other side of the underpas is a small walking path that leads directly to the front gate of the Church of the Brethren denominational compound; the sign reads, &ldquo;AREÁL CÍRKVE BRATRSKÉ CHVALY.&rdquo; The PTH is the first building on your right; it has a reddish brick facade. As you approach the building, take the sidewalk that will lead you up the left side. There are two entrances to the building. The first entrance is to the Grulich apartment, the second is to the PTH.

<b>Coming by car</b>
<p>
The PTH is basically at the intersection of E65 and E67 on the eastern border of Prague&#39;s city limits, about &ldquo;2:30 on the clock.&rdquo; <B>If you are in Prague</B>, follow the signs for &ldquo;Mladá Boleslav.&rdquo; This will eventually lead you to highway E65 (often labeled together with E55 or others). If you are on Chlumecká (&ldquo;Centrum Černý Most&rdquo; will be visible on your right hand side), do not exit either towards Hradec Králové or Mladá Boleslav; instead continue on Chlumecká under E65 to the first stoplight. Turn right (the Jet/Conoco gas station will be on the near right corner) and continue straight until you come to a sharp right bend in the road; the PTH entrance (a green entrance gate) will be directly in front of you with the sign, &ldquo;AREÁL CÍRKVE BRATRSKÉ CHVALY.&rdquo; Park your car in the parking lot immediately to the right of the gate. The PTH is the red brick building in front of you.
</p><p>
<b>If you are heading north on E65</b> towards the PTH, there will be a major exit east to &ldquo;Hradec Králové;&rdquo; this is highway E67. Go past this exit and take the next exit that says, &ldquo;Nákupní zóna.&rdquo; It will bring you back around under E65 and wind around a bit past a gas station, IKEA and Village Cinemas. At the first four-way intersection (the second &ldquo;round about&rdquo;), take the first right and proceed under an underpass (below E65) and continue another 100 meters or so to a T-intersection. Turn left, go about 50 meters and the PTH entrance (a green entrance gate) will be on your right with the sign, &ldquo;AREÁL CÍRKVE BRATRSKÉ CHVALY.&rdquo; Park your car in the parking lot immediately to the right of the gate. The PTH is the red brick building in front of you.
</p><p>
<b>If you are heading south on E65</b> towards the PTH, there will be a major exit west to &ldquo;Praha Centrum;&rdquo; this takes you into downtown Prague. Go past this exit and take the next exit that says, &ldquo;Nákupní zóna.&rdquo; You will exit off to your right and wind around a bit past a gas station, IKEA and Village Cinemas. At the first four-way intersection (the second &ldquo;round about&rdquo;), take the first right and proceed under an underpass (below E65) and continue another 100 meters or so to a T-intersection. Turn left, go about 50 meters and the PTH entrance (a green entrance gate) will be on your right with the sign, &ldquo;AREÁL CÍRKVE BRATRSKÉ CHVALY.&rdquo; Park your car in the parking lot immediately to the right of the gate. The PTH is the red brick building in front of you.
