<h3>Information for Applicants to the PTH University Discipleship Community</h3>
<h5>Dear Friends,</h5><p>
 You have in yourhands information about the possibilities for admission into the Prague Tyrannus Hall discipleship community. If you yourself are not a student, please encourage a potential candidate to consider this opportunity.
</p><p>
 Tyrannus Halls International is a small mission organization of roughly a 16 student communities in seven countries around the world. The activities of the individual communities are varied according to local conditions, however they always include four fundamental features: corporate quiet times led by students, sports, theological lectures (during university years, a student will receive the equivalent of one year of seminary education) and ministry together. The Prague community has the unique opportunity to deepen the discipling process via the planting of a new church. The PTH facility is the center of the new church whose mission focus is the apartment complex of Cerny Most and vicinity.  We believe that in this environment mature and godly leaders will develop who will have a great influence on the secular marketplace.
</p><p>
 The Prague Tyrannus Hall opened in September, 2000. We are grateful that we are seeing the first fruits of this ministry. Presently we have 8 students from various denominations in this community and we would like to accept others for the upcoming school year. The maximum capacity is 16 university students.
</p><p>
 This discipleship community is led by Steve Olsen (PTH Chairman and ETS Teacher) and Tom as Grulich (CB Cerny Most Pastor and PTH Director). Even though these leaders are prepared to dedicate themselves to the students, a great emphasis is laid on peer discipleship between the students. Via delegated responsibilities in the areas of facility care, spiritual life or organization of community life, students learn practical leadership skills. Spiritual maturity is built in and through the intensive interaction of community life. And through practical ministry experience in planting a new church or through ministry in their home church, students grow in their responsibility for building the Kingdom of God.
</p>
<h4>Conditions for Acceptance at PTH</h4>
<p>
 The Prague Tyrannus Hall is open to single, Christian men who will begin their non-theological university studies in September in Prague (secondary consideration will be given those entering their 2<SUP>nd</SUP> year of studies). We are interested in long-term discipleship relationships over the period of one&rsquo;s university years. We prefer those entering in a master&rsquo;s degree programs, although we are open for students in bachelor programs. The main requirement is a vibrant personal faith and commitment to serve the Lord Jesus.Therefore we also ask that your obtain a recommendation form your church leader on the application form. The discipleship community is open for Christians from various denominations.
</p>
<h4>Housing Conditions</h4>
<p>
 The Prague Tyrannus Hall provides two-bed rooms with toilet facilities and much more. Students have access to a kitchen, dining room, gym, lounge, study room, laundry room and storage space for their things during the summers. The PTH facility is also the center for the newly developing CB church. The PTH is located on the Church of the Brethren denominational grounds in Chvaly, less than a 15-minute walk from the Cerny Most metro station. Monthly rent has been set at 2400 crowns <I>(Czech crowns)</I> per month for the 2008-2009 school year, which is comparable with similarly-equipped university dorms.
</p>
<h4>Admission Procedure</h4>
<p>
 It is best to send your application as soon as possible, even if you have not yet been accepted yet into the university. We schedule admission interviews each June. The decision regarding your admission will be made the same day. In the event there is still an open spot, admission interviews for another date will be set. The admission committee accepts new students into the discipleship community on the basis of 1) a <a href="dokumenty/prihlaska.pdf">written application</a> with attached Christian testimony, 2) the recommendation of the student&rsquo;s church leader and 3) the admission&rsquo;s interview. Admission to the PTH discipleship program is for a maximum of 5&nbsp;years. If a student is interested in extending his time in the discipleship program, he must apply anew for each extra year.
</p>
<h3>Information for PTH Friends</h3>
<p>
 University dormitories receive government subsidies. The price paid by the student is far from the actual cost of his residency. The PTH, which is not part of the university system and which provides housing for a discipleship program exclusively for Christian students, cannot receive government subsidies. Because we do not want to burden students with the actual costs of their housing, we must rely on gifts from sponsors and individual donors. If this kind of ministry lies on your heart and you can financial support or regularly contribute, we give to you our bank account number where you can send your gifts.
