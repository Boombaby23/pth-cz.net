<h3>GIVE US A &ldquo;CORNELIUS&rdquo;</h3>
<IMG SRC="archiv/grafika/lide/olsenovi2.jpg" alt="Olsen family" class="fr" />

<i>By Steve Olsen as told to Don Crawfod</i>

<pre>
Some people would have called our trip
foolhardy. But I kept telling myself
we were acting on faith.

There were three of us traveling
to Eastern Europe shortly after the
countries there had revolted against
Communism. Our goal was to determine
whether church leaders in this unsettled
part of the world would be interested
in a mission such as ours. The only
problem was we had no contacts there.
And no place to stay. Not even train
tickets back!

At the time we made the trip, I was
a student at Biola University
in California, completing my work
for a doctorate in cross-cultural education. My wife Julie and I
were expecting our fifth child. It wasn&rsquo;t an ideal time
to think about travel, but I&rsquo;d felt the Lord&rsquo;s
leading to work for Him in Eastern Europe.

The one who organized our
trip was Dr. Charles Corwin. Chuck and Elouise, his wife, are the
founders of Tyrannus Halls International, a ministry that establishes
residence halls on secular university campuses around the world. THI
derives its name from the Ephesian lecture hall mentioned in the Book
of Acts, in which the Apostle Paul reasoned for the faith. The goal
of each Tyrannus hall is to challenge the Christian men who live
there to impact their world for Christ.

The third member of our
group was John Winston, founder and president emeritus of the only
evangelical graduate school of theology in France. John, who speaks
several European languages, acted as our European mentor and
interpreter on our visits to Budapest, Bucharest, and Prague

I was excited about the
possibility of being part of a THI ministry overseas. But the more
Chuck told me about the proposed trip, the more I could see it was
truly a venture of faith. He pointed out that, because Eastern Europe
had been virtually closed to mission work and contacts were hared to
establish, we&rsquo;d have to trust the Lord to guide us.

A couple of months before we
started our trip, my devotional reading brought me to the Book of
Acts. It wasn&rsquo;t the first time I&rsquo;d read the book, but it
was the first time chapter 10 made such an impression on me.

Two visions are recorded in
this chapter. In one, God instructs a devout Roman centurion named
Cornelius to send for the Apostle Peter. In the other vision, God
encourages the reluctant apostle to go to the centurion with the
message of salvation. Both men obeyed, with wonderful results, as the
early Christians later summed it up: &ldquo;God has granted even the
Gentiles repentance unto life&rdquo; (Acts 11:18, NIV).

It
hit me hard that, without God&rsquo;s direct intervention in two
people&rsquo;s lives, the Gospel of Jesus Christ might not have
reached the Gentile world. In a sense, I could identify with Peter.
Just as the apostle needed a Cornelius for his outreach to the
Gentiles of Judea, I needed contacts in Eastern Europe for a Gospel
ministry there.

So for two
months before we left, I petitioned the Lord, &ldquo;Give us a
&lsquo;Cornelius&rsquo; or two&mdash;people who can open the door to
a Tyrannus Hall ministry in Eastern Europe.&rdquo; I used the name
<I>Cornelius</I> because it reminded me of how specifically the Lord
had guided Peter. I wanted our contacts to be arranged by the Lord as
well.

But time was running out and
Chuck had come up with very few contacts, though he had used every
avenue he could think of. In Budapest, for example, he was able to
get the names of only three persons and one church&mdash;but no
addresses and just two phone numbers.

Not one definite appointment
had been set up by the time Chuck and I flew to Paris, where we were
joined by John Winston. There we boarded the Orient Express for a
22-hour train ride to Budapest, still without a specific contact. It
was totally a trip of faith&mdash;or foolishness.

The travel guide we
contacted at the station in Budapest, after our arrival Saturday
evening, had no trouble defining our journey. He told us, &ldquo;It
is foolish to come to Budapest in the summer without reservations.&rdquo;
We tried the National Tourism Office, but the prices for available
accommodations were exorbitant.

Discouraged,
we returned to the street. There Chuck followed an impulse and spoke
to a well-dressed lady. She told us in English that her husband was a
diplomatic economist. More than that, she offered a place where we
could stay for half the price the Tourism Office had quoted.

Though unsure at first, we
later praised the Lord for this blessing. Our benefactor, Maria
Mihályné, directed us to eating places that were within our budget and made
phone calls in Hungarian for us. At least she tried. The first number
she dialed produced no answer. We learned later it was a
denominational headquarters, closed on Saturday night.

The second number was that
of another denominational headquarters, but someone was there to
answer the phone. We arranged an appointment for the following
Tuesday.

The third name on Chuck&rsquo;s
list did not include a telephone number and our hostess couldn&rsquo;t
find the name in the book. So we were down to the last source, which
was just the name of a church. No address. No phone number.

With a shrug, Chuck showed
the name to Maria. She knew the church! She gave us directions, and
we decided to attend the church in the morning.

It was a drizzly day that
Sunday. We tried to follow the directions we&rsquo;d been given, but
we got lost. Asking for help from people on the street proved
frustrating. We finally found the church and entered late, as the
choir was singing.

n elderly man in the back
row saw us enter and came into the foyer to greet us. Discovering we
were Westerners, he motioned for us to sit in the back pew. When the
choir finished singing, the man slipped away, returning shortly with
a young choir member who became our interpreter for the service.

That encounter proved to be
a breakthrough for us. After the service, we learned that the choir
member, who spoke excellent English, had headed the Hungarian
Fellowship of Evangelical Students the past 10 years. He was also a
busy physician in a city of 2.2 million people. Chuck shared the
purpose of our visit and enlisted his support. He agreed to meet with
other leaders and see what he could do.

With our faith bolstered,
we traveled on to Bucharest via night train. We could only purchase
one-way tickets, because Romanian regulations required that outbound
transportation be arranged within the country.

Around 7:00 the next
morning, the train made a stop at a station about two hours outside
of Bucharest. I was sleepily looking out at the scenery when I
noticed four teenage boys approaching our car. One of the boys was
lifted up to the open window of the cabin next to the one Chuck,
John, and I were in. I realized what the teens were doing when I saw
them walk away with a handbag.

I rushed to the next cabin.
The occupants&mdash;a man and a woman&mdash;were in the aisle,
looking out the opposite window. I gestured frantically toward their
cabin and they stepped back in. Rushing to the open window, the
couple yelled at the retreating teenagers.

The conductor was alerted,
but by this time the boys had slipped through another standing train
and escaped. John was able to speak to the woman, who told him that
the thieves had stolen a bag of prescription drugs. They had not
touched a bag that contained money and passports.

The lady was so grateful
for my intervention that, when she learned we had no accommodations
in Bucharest, she insisted that we be the guests of her family. Once
again, the Lord had provided help from an unexpected source.

Like Maria in Budapest, our
&ldquo;angel&rdquo; in Bucharest, Sonia Vitzu, made telephone calls
to the few contacts Chuck had, to set up appointments. We were
grateful for her many courtesies, but we realized how truly
miraculous our association was when it was time to leave Romania.

We could hardly believe our
ears when Sonia told us it would take two or three days to get a
train ticket. If it took us that long, we might have to bypass Prague
to get to Paris in time to catch our plane home. She insisted on
accompanying us to the train station.

We arrived at the station
at 10:00 in the morning, and were dismayed to see about 200 people
lined up at the ticket counter. Sonia told John she knew some people
and excused herself. About 20 minutes later, she returned and told us
we were free to leave. We could come back at 4:00 to pick up our
tickets!

We used the time we&rsquo;d
been spared from the ticket line for meetings with the president of
the Romanian Evangelical Alliance, the director of an evangelical
seminary, and other key contacts for establishing a THI ministry in
Bucharest.

Then we took a 26-hour
train ride to Prague. As with the other locations, we had names and
phone numbers but no set appointments.

We arrived Sunday morning
and found a church to attend. There were only about 40 people at the
service. But, in another one of those little miracles of our journey,
we &ldquo;happened&rdquo; to encounter Pavel Vychopen, the president
of an association of Protestant denominations in the country, who
&ldquo;happened&rdquo; to attend that church that Sunday.

He in turn introduced us to
leaders interested in THI, including Karel Taschner, General
Secretary of Czechoslovakia&rsquo;s Brethren churches. Through this
single contact, God opened the door for my future ministry in Eastern
Europe. As this is being written, I am preparing to move with my
family to Prague to join the faculty of a developing seminary and
head the THI work in Eastern Europe. Julie and I should be there with
our children, studying the Czech language, as you read these words.

The trip I&rsquo;d made
with Chuck Corwin and John Winston must have seemed foolish to some.
But it strengthened my faith in a God who answers prayer&mdash;even
as unusual a prayer as mine for &ldquo;Corneliuses.&rdquo;

On a later visit to Eastern
Europe, Chuck and I were excited to see the results of our original
journey. Among the people we saw again was the English-speaking
doctor who had been pulled from the choir to be our interpreter. He
had already identified a potential staff member for a developing
Tyrannus Hall in Budapest!

Did I mention his name?
It&rsquo;s Kornél Herjeczki. Kornél is the Hungarian equivalent of <I>Cornelius</I>.
